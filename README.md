#The expected outcomes of this analytical pipeline are that the results of the dynamic X/A ratios, 
#the contribution value of each X-linked gene, the identification of XCU-contributing genes, 
#and the features of XCU-contributing genes. 
#Furtherly, incorporating the analysis of chromatin accessibility, histone modification, DNA methylation, 
#and transcription factor binding sites with our expected outcomes could deeply explore the features of XCU.
